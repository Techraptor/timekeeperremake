    Change month through buttons was successful but ended up opening up a bug that was unseen. I worked with Dustin to
    help fix this bug (1 Hour) and some slight cleanup of the code took place. The major bug was only a line that needed
    deleting.

    added highlighting of current day,
    new bug: Calendar does not work properly if a month starts on a Saturday
